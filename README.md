SpringExpressionLanguage

The Spring Expression Language (SpEL) is a powerful expression language that supports querying and manipulating an object graph at runtime. We can use it with XML or annotation-based Spring configurations.

There are several operators available in the language:

Type	Operators
Arithmetic	+, -, *, /, %, ^, div, mod
Relational	<, >, ==, !=, <=, >=, lt, gt, eq, ne, le, ge
Logical	and, or, not, &&, ||, !
Conditional	?:
Regex	matches
